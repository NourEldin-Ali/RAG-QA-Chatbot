Vector databases store high-dimensional numerical representations of data, known as embeddings. These embeddings allow efficient similarity searches based on vector distances rather than keyword matching.

Popular vector databases include Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant, and ChromaDB. They are widely used for AI applications, such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 

ChromaDB, in particular, is lightweight and optimized for storing and retrieving text embeddings, making it a popular choice for integrating with LangChain and Ollama.
