LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for connecting language models with external data sources, chaining multiple LLM calls, and managing AI-powered workflows. 

LangChain is widely used for building AI-powered chatbots, search applications, and data analysis tools. It integrates seamlessly with various databases, APIs, and vector stores to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge retrieval.
